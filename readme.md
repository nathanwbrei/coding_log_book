Coding Log Book
---------------

The purpose of this project is to start tracking pieces of exploratory coding. These are all small, unimpressive, and rushed,
usually for the purpose of learning something in the process of tackling a bigger goal. Previously they would get deleted. 
However, oftentimes the exploratory coding doesn't immediately lead to an immediate actionable solution, but needs to 
gestate and iterate. Having these snippets available in an organized fashion could come in handy. Furthermore, having 
a convenient playground such as this could lower the ergonomic barrier to doing more exploration in the first place, which 
would shorten the time needed per iteration, increasing productivity.
